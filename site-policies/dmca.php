                <h1>DMCA Policy</h1>
                <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 26, 2025</p>
                <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://reseer.life">reseer.life</a><br>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I take copyright seriously. This website, <strong>Reseer J</strong>, is a personal project — I share
                    things I’ve written, created, or curated because I believe in open access to information and ideas.
                    However, if something on this site uses your copyrighted material in a way you think violates your
                    rights, I’ll review it and, if appropriate, take it down quickly.
                </p>

                <h2>DMCA Takedown Requests</h2>
                <p>
                    If you believe that content hosted on this website infringes your copyright, you can send a DMCA
                    notice.
                    To help me verify and act on your request as efficiently as possible, please include the following
                    information:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your full name, company (if applicable), and contact information (email, phone, and mailing
                        address).</li>
                    <li>A clear description of the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed.</li>
                    <li>The exact URL(s) on <a href="https://reseer.life">reseer.life</a> where the infringing content
                        is located.</li>
                    <li>A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the use of
                        the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
                    <li>A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright
                        owner or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.</li>
                    <li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Please send all DMCA notices to:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Resteer John L. Lumbab</strong><br>
                    Email: <a href="mailto:connect@reseer.life">connect@reseer.life</a><br>
                    Subject line: <strong>DMCA Notice - Reseer J</strong>
                </p>

                <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
                <p>
                    Once I receive a valid DMCA notice, I’ll remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing
                    material. I’ll also notify the person who posted it, if applicable.
                    If that person believes the removal was in error or that they have a legitimate right to use the
                    content (for example, fair use, license, or public domain), they can send a counter-notice.
                </p>

                <h2>Counter-Notice Procedure</h2>
                <p>
                    If your material was removed in response to a DMCA notice and you believe this was a mistake, you
                    may submit a counter-notice. Your counter-notice must include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your full name, contact information, and signature (physical or electronic).</li>
                    <li>Identification of the material that was removed and the location where it appeared before
                        removal.</li>
                    <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was
                        removed as a result of mistake or misidentification.</li>
                    <li>Your consent to the jurisdiction of the appropriate legal authorities in the Philippines.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Send your counter-notice to the same contact email above. If a valid counter-notice is received, I
                    may restore the removed content after 10–14 business days, unless the original complainant notifies
                    me that they’ve filed a court action.
                </p>

                <h2>Important Notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I’m not a lawyer, and this site isn’t operated by a big company with a legal department. I’ll do
                        my best to respond reasonably and fairly.</li>
                    <li>Sending false or misleading claims under the DMCA can have legal consequences. Please be sure of
                        your claim before filing.</li>
                    <li>Much of what I share on this site may come from the public domain or licensed materials. In
                        those cases, takedowns might not apply.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Final Word</h2>
                <p>
                    This site exists to share ideas, information, and resources — not to steal from others. If there’s a
                    genuine issue, reach out respectfully, and I’ll handle it with the same respect.
                </p>
