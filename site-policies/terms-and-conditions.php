                <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://reseer.life" target="_blank"

                <h2>1. What This Site Is</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reseer J</strong> is a personal blog where I share opinions, notes, projects, and
                    observations.
                    It’s not a company, store, or paid service. Reading this site means you understand it’s
                    written from my personal perspective, for informational or entertainment purposes only.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Accepting These Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    If you visit or read this website, you agree to these terms.
                    If something here doesn’t sit right with you, you can simply stop using the site.
                    There’s no account to cancel, no subscription fee to refund.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Use of Content</h2>
                <p>
                    Everything on this site—text, images, and other materials—is created or curated by me unless
                    otherwise noted.
                    You’re free to quote or share short excerpts for fair use, reviews, or educational commentary,
                    as long as you link back to the original post and don’t misrepresent it.
                    You may not copy full posts, host my files, or re-publish large sections without permission.
                    Just ask first; I usually say yes to reasonable requests.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>
                    All original materials on <strong>Reseer J</strong> belong to me, Resteer John L. Lumbab.
                    Trademarks, logos, or images owned by others remain their property.
                    This site’s name and design are part of my creative work—please respect that.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Accuracy and Opinions</h2>
                <p>
                    Everything written here is based on my own understanding, research, or experience at the time of
                    writing.
                    I try to be accurate, but mistakes can happen. None of this is professional advice—legal, technical,
                    financial, or otherwise.
                    Use your own judgment before applying anything from this site in real life.
                </p>

                <h2>6. External Links</h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I link to other websites for context or reference. I don’t control those sites,
                    and I’m not responsible for their content, privacy practices, or accuracy.
                    If a link breaks or leads somewhere sketchy later, let me know, and I’ll fix or remove it.
                </p>

                <h2>7. No Warranties</h2>
                <p>
                    This website is provided “as is.” I don’t guarantee uptime, speed, or accuracy.
                    I’m not liable for any loss, inconvenience, or damage caused by visiting this site,
                    downloading files, or relying on information here.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Privacy and Data</h2>
                <p>
                    I keep minimal data and don’t sell or share it.
                    For details, read the <a href="#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
                    In short: no cookies, no tracking ads, no user accounts—just basic analytics from GoatCounter
                    and any emails you personally send me.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Communication</h2>
                <p>
                    The only official contact method is through direct email:
                    <a href="mailto:connect@reseer.life">connect@reseer.life</a>.
                    If you email me, keep it respectful and relevant.
                    Anything abusive, spammy, or malicious gets ignored or filtered out.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    I may update these Terms occasionally to reflect new features or clarify something.
                    When that happens, I’ll post the revised date at the top.
                    Continued use of the site means you accept the updated version.
                </p>

                <h2>11. Termination of Access</h2>
                <p>
                    I reserve the right to block or restrict access to the site for any reason—security, abuse,
                    scraping, or anything else that disrupts its normal use. This rarely happens, but it’s an option.
                </p>

                <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.
                    Any disputes related to this website will be handled under Philippine jurisdiction.
                </p>

                <h2>13. Contact</h2>
                <p>
                    For any questions about these Terms, reach out via email at
                    <a href="mailto:connect@reseer.life">connect@reseer.life</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>14. Closing Words</h2>
                <p>
                    This site exists to share ideas and experiences, not to trap readers in legal jargon.
                    I believe in open communication and mutual respect—treat this space accordingly.
                    If something’s unclear, ask me directly, and I’ll give you a straightforward answer.
                </p>
