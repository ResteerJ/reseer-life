                <h2>1. Personal Blog, Not a Company</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reseer J</strong> is my personal space on the internet.
                    It’s where I write, document projects, share opinions, and sometimes rant.
                    Nothing here represents any company, organization, or employer — past, present, or future.
                    It’s just me, writing what I think and believe at the moment.
                </p>

                <h2>2. No Professional Advice</h2>
                <p>
                    The content on this site isn’t professional advice of any kind — not legal, financial, technical, or
                    medical.
                    If I talk about fixing something, learning, or doing a project, it’s based on my own experience and
                    understanding.
                    Use your own judgment and do your own research before applying anything you read here.
                    I’m not responsible if you try something and it doesn’t go as planned.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Accuracy and Updates</h2>
                <p>
                    I do my best to make sure information is accurate at the time I post it.
                    But the web changes, tools change, and people make mistakes — me included.
                    There’s no guarantee that what I wrote last year, or even last week, is still correct.
                    If you spot something wrong, let me know, and I’ll review or fix it.
                </p>

                <h2>4. External Links</h2>
                <p>
                    Occasionally, I link to other websites, videos, or resources for reference.
                    Those are outside my control. I don’t endorse or take responsibility for their content, reliability,
                    or privacy practices.
                    If one of those links breaks or turns into spam later, that’s not intentional — just let me know,
                    and I’ll remove it.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Liability</h2>
                <p>
                    You use this site at your own risk.
                    I’m not liable for any damage, data loss, or problems that result from using the content here —
                    whether that’s code, instructions, or opinions.
                    If you decide to apply something you read here, it’s entirely your choice and responsibility.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Affiliate Links or Sponsorships</h2>
                <p>
                    As of now, <strong>Reseer J</strong> has no affiliate links, ads, or sponsored posts.
                    If I ever include them in the future, I’ll make it clear right next to the link or article — no
                    hidden disclosures, no tricks.
                    Transparency comes first.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Comments, Emails, and Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s no public comment section on this site.
                    If you contact me by email, your message is private.
                    I may respond personally, but I won’t post, publish, or share your emails without permission.
                    I also reserve the right to ignore spam, hate mail, or irrelevant messages.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Content Ownership</h2>
                <p>
                    All written material, images, and media on this website (unless otherwise credited) are my own.
                    You’re welcome to quote short parts or share links, as long as you credit <strong>Reseer J</strong>
                    and link back to the original page.
                    Don’t copy, republish, or mirror entire articles without asking first.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Changes to This Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>
                    I may update this Disclaimer from time to time, especially if the site grows or adds new features.
                    Any changes will be posted here, with an updated effective date.
                    By continuing to use the site after updates, you agree to the revised version.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Contact</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have any questions or concerns about this Disclaimer, email me at
                    <a href="mailto:connect@reseer.life">connect@reseer.life</a>.
                    You’ll get a straightforward answer — no auto-replies, no legal maze.
                </p>

                <h2>11. Closing Note</h2>
                <p>
                    This site is about ideas, curiosity, and sharing what I learn — not legal fine print.
                    The best way to understand what this blog stands for is to read it with an open mind, not a
                    magnifying glass.
                    I write honestly, but I expect readers to use common sense.
                </p>
