                <h2>1. What This Site Is About</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a personal blog, not a startup, marketing funnel, or data-harvesting platform. I share
                    thoughts, stories, opinions, and personal projects.
                    There are no investors, ad networks, or hidden data deals. If you’re here, I assume you came to
                    read—not to be tracked.
                </p>

                <h2>2. What Data I Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    I keep it simple. This website collects only what’s necessary to run and understand basic traffic.
                    Here’s what that means:
                </p>

                <h3>2.1. Analytics (GoatCounter)</h3>
                <p>
                    I use <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">GoatCounter</a> for analytics.
                    It’s a privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics. It doesn’t use cookies, doesn’t fingerprint
                    you,
                    and doesn’t follow you across the web. What it tells me is limited to anonymous numbers—like how
                    many people visited a page,
                    which country the visit came from (roughly), and what browser or device was used.
                    That’s it. It’s like counting how many people walked past a shop window, not tracking where they go
                    afterward.
                </p>

                <h3>2.2. Email Contact</h3>
                <p>
                    There’s no contact form on this site. If you want to talk to me, you’ll need to email me directly at
                    <a href="mailto:connect@reseer.life">connect@reseer.life</a>.
                    When you do that, your message and email address are stored in my inbox—just like any normal human
                    conversation.
                    I don’t sell, forward, or share these emails. I reply manually, and that’s the end of it.
                </p>

                <h3>2.3. Newsletter “Form”</h3>
                <p>
                    There’s no automated subscription box. If you click “Subscribe,” it just opens your email client
                    with a pre-filled message saying you want to join the newsletter.
                    If you send it, I manually add your email address to a small list I keep locally.
                    No marketing software, no tracking pixels, and no third-party mailing service.
                    If you want to unsubscribe, just reply or send another email asking to be removed—I’ll handle it
                    myself.
                </p>

                <h3>2.4. No Comments, No Accounts, No Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    There’s no comment system, no login feature, and no cookies that follow you around.
                    You can read freely without being identified.
                    If I ever add something that changes how data works here, I’ll update this page first.
                </p>

                <h2>3. How Data Is Stored and Handled</h2>
                <p>
                    Emails you send are stored in my personal email inbox, which is protected by strong passwords and
                    2FA.
                    The small newsletter list is kept securely and privately.
                    I don’t sync it with any marketing tool or cloud CRM system.
                    I don’t sell or rent data to anyone. I don’t share it unless legally required by proper authority
                    (and that’s extremely unlikely).
                </p>

                <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>GoatCounter:</strong> Used for privacy-friendly web analytics.
                        It may process anonymized technical data like your browser type or rough region.
                        You can read their privacy policy here:
                        <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Aside from GoatCounter, this site doesn’t use any external scripts, ad networks, social widgets, or
                    analytics trackers.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>
                    I keep emails as long as they’re relevant—for example, while we’re still communicating or you’re
                    subscribed to the newsletter.
                    If you ask me to delete them, I will. GoatCounter analytics data is aggregated and anonymized; I
                    can’t identify you from it anyway.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
                <p>
                    Depending on where you live, you may have legal rights over your personal data—like requesting
                    access, correction, or deletion.
                    If you want to exercise any of these rights, just email me directly at
                    <a href="mailto:connect@reseer.life">connect@reseer.life</a>.
                    I’ll personally take care of it without sending you through hoops.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    This site isn’t directed at children under 18. I don’t knowingly collect data from minors.
                    If you think I somehow did, email me and I’ll delete it immediately.And You are not allowed in my wesbite to browse.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
                <p>
                    I may update this Privacy Policy if I add new features or services that involve more data.
                    I’ll keep the language human and the details clear.
                    The date at the top will always show when this policy was last updated.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    I built <strong>Reseer J</strong> to write and share—not to profile or monetize readers.
                    Privacy matters, and I treat it as basic respect, not as a legal checkbox.
                    If you ever have questions about how I handle data, just email me directly. You’ll get a real human
                    answer.
                </p>
